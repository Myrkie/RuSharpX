RuSharpX - A next-gen C# library for interacting with FTP Rush (v2!)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
RuSharpX is a library that allows C# software to interact with the
FTP Rush v2 client.

RuSharpX offers both interop/IPC capabilities for modern .NET apps,
but it also offers a foundational layer for reading and writing
RushFXP Queue (RFQ) files to automate batch up/downloads via external
means.

Most of the code in this library has been documented via C# XmlDoc comments.

This library is offered and distributed in raw source code form with 
dual-licensing, under the "Good Luck With That Shit" (GLWTS) Public License, 
as well as the MIT No-Attribution (MIT-0) License in the case that for some 
reason you want to use this and require compliance with some sort of license
policy.

I would release this into the public domain if I could, but that would require
registering this work. As such, it is released with pseudonymous copyrights under
those licenses. I do not care what you do with it, cause thermonuclear war for all
I care. Just don't point the finger at me when you get fired because your alarm clock
didn't fire off.

I have nothing to do with Marsup, aka the original author of RuSharp.
